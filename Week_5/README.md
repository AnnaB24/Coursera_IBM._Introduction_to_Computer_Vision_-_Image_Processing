## Week 4. Object Detection

In this module, you will learn about object detection with different methods. The first approach is using the Haar Cascade classifier, the second one is to use R-CNN and MobileNet.

  

### Learning Objectives

-   Evaluate the classification Performance of Haar Cascade Classifiers
    
-   Evaluate the classification performance of these CNN models
    
-   Compare the results different models
